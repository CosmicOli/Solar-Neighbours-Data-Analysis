# Solar-Neighbours-Data-Analysis
Code used to process and analyse exoplanet data as part of the UoB module Physics Laboratory 1 Astrolab.

NEARBY.csv contains the apparent visual magnitudes, B-V colour indexes and the trigonometric parallaxes of various stars as observed from earth.

The code is in 4 sections.
Section 1: Plots the stars on a HR diagram and colours the plot based on where various stellar types would be located, as well as indicating where the sun would be.
Section 2: Plots the stars on a HR diagram and shows a defining region for the main sequence stars.
Section 3: Plots only the main sequence stars on a HR diagram and plots a histogram of frequencies of different star brightnesses. This is to show the biases of star types in the local solar neighbourhood.
Section 4: Plots a graph and a log graph of stellar density as a function of distance from Earth. This is to show that the number of stars recorded is not an accurate sample of the total neighbourhood, as the density should be about constant.
